# Overview
ProjectX is a web application project aimed at building a responsive and user-friendly platform.
This README provides an overview of the project, along with instructions on how to run it.

### Getting started
[see this file](../README.md)

## Repository Initialization and Structure

### Repository Creation
A new repository named "ProjectX" has been created on GitHub to manage version control and 
collaboration.

### Folder Structure
The repository follows a structured layout:

- **src**: Contains the source code for the web application.
- **docs**: Includes documentation related to the project.
- **tests**: Houses testing-related files.

## Branching and Initial Development

### Feature Branch - "feature/add-homepage"
A new branch named "feature/add-homepage" has been created to develop the homepage of the web 
application. This branch includes a one-page website built with HTML/CSS in the "src" folder. 
The website comprises sections such as a header, about, services, contact, etc.

## Collaboration and Pull Requests with Another Student

Tapiwa was invited to collaborate on the repository. He created a branch 
named "feature/add-about-page," made changes related to an about page, and submitted a 
pull request to merge it into the main branch.

### Pull Request Review
The pull request was reviewed, providing constructive comments and suggestions for improvement. 
Feedback includes recommendations for potential enhancements.

## Merging and Conflict Resolution

### Merge "feature/add-about-page" into Main
The "feature/add-about-page" branch has been successfully merged into the main branch.

### Conflict Resolution
A deliberate conflict was introduced between the main branch and the "feature/add-homepage" branch
by modifying the same line in a file. The conflict was resolved by carefully merging the changes 
and committing the resolution.

## Version Control Analysis and Problem-solving by Bug Introduction and Resolution

A bug was intentionally introduced in the code (e.g., a typo, logic error) in one of the branches.
Git commands (git log) were used to identify the commit that introduced the bug. The steps to rectify 
the bug were then executed, including reverting or modifying the code to eliminate the error.

## Documentation and Repository Management

### README Update
The README file has been updated with instructions on how to run the project, providing a
clear guide for users.

### Branch Management
All branches have been appropriately managed, but there were no unnecessary branches to delete 
in order to maintain a clean and organized repository.

## Summary
This lab exam involved the creation of the "ProjectX" repository, branching for feature development, 
collaboration with another student, pull request review, merging, conflict resolution, 
bug identification and resolution, and documentation updates. The repository is now ready 
for further development and collaboration.
